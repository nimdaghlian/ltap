<h2>Even if Great Artists Steal, the Machines are Doing Something Different</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>this is a fragment from a larger set of interconnected essays about AI Art which will be pubished here soon. check back for more or follow me on <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@nim">mastodon</a> or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/niiiiim.bsky.social">bluesky</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the most reliable cul-de-sacs for arguments over AI art online to find themselves in is when someone justifies their use of an image generator with the old chestnut “Good artists copy; Great artist steal.” Sometimes attributed to Picasso, sometimes to David Bowie, but seemingly never to Steve Jobs, even though <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/">he’s responsible</a> both for its modern popularity and the notion that Picasso said it.</p>

<p>There’s no point in arguing with an aphorism, especially one wielded as a way to ward off criticism. If you read the link investigating its origins, you’ll see how non-authoritative the cliché is, as well as how it’s mainly non-artists getting versions of the statement into print. In no case is there an argument for the morality of stealing, only the effectiveness of it, and one of the earliest variants is reversed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…great poets imitate and improve, whereas small ones steal and spoil.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides being just a saying, and not a natural law, the biggest problem with this line is that it’s describing <em>stealing on purpose</em>. The machines can’t do that. The idea that “great artists steal” implies that they know what’s good, where to find it, and how to use it, and by god they’re going to because they’re Great Artists.</p>

<p>I suppose we could read it as less intentional; if they’re merely drawing on their pool of influences, their voice is so full and sure that they <em>become</em> the influence rather than the influenced. But I think this is contrary to the usage of the quote. It’s a way of saying “sure, I stole stuff in my picture, but that’s what great artists do. I know I stole and that’s how great art gets made.”</p>

<p>I think it’s fair to assume that this Great Artist we’re talking about has some knowledge of the art they’re making and the art they’re stealing from to make it. And, as of this writing, it’s fairly easy to prove that image generators don’t. Using a tool that can both describe and generate images, such as ChatGPT, ask it to create a <em>collage</em> – not a cohesive image, but a collage – from the work of a specific artist or historical era or movement. First off, you’ll see that it’s not as good at making interesting collages as it is at making coherent pictures. Collages work on an understanding of boundaries, separation, meaningful depiction, and juxtaposition, all things that are very challenging for LLMs to deal with. But then ask it to name the specific works it used. As of 2025, it cannot. There may be some tuned hesitance in order to avoid liability, but <em>stealing</em> and then <em>re-presenting creatively</em> is just simply not what’s going on.</p>

<p>Even if “great artists steal” were as true and meaningful as those who use the phrase seem to think it is, no one is claiming that “great artist steal and then grind everything up into a slurry of averages.”</p>
