    <blockquote>Painting is not the only discipline to say, in one way or another, that the real work is beyond the craft of the work. If you&rsquo;re not a painter, but some of the tweets above rang true for the particular thing you are trying to do, then you&rsquo;re familiar with this kind of work. This essay is about what that work seems to be, what it is like to do it within a discipline, and how different fields share this particular method. <a href="the-thing-i-am-trying-to-do.html">Here's an essay about that work, starting with painting but looking for it in many other places.</a></blockquote>

<h3>Looking and technical skills</h3>

<p>Most of painting is looking, but that doesn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re doing the work you think you should be doing, and the hand gets in the way of the eye. So for beginners, we will separately train the eye and the hand before trying to integrate them. Half of the work will be out of the studio, visiting parks, galleries, museums, and talking about other mediums including music, dance, writing, and your personal lives. The other half will be material-focused. We will explore and work with materials with the goal of clearing the way for you to begin satisfying your own curiosity and interest in particular materials. For example, we will seek to answer questions you&#8217;ve always had about the use or behavior of certain materials, or to find materials and methods that feel right to you if you haven&#8217;t done that yet. In both contexts, you will be challenged to explore beyond your comfort zones, which is one of the main reasons to ever take a class instead of simply practicing by yourself. </p>

<p>The goal of this unit is to develop your ability to use art materials to facilitate critical, insightful looking. This is an ongoing process that you will follow cyclically for as long as you make art, so there is no point of graduation from this stage. We will evaluate your progress at the end of this unit by discussing your awareness of the process, and by your ability to talk about how your chosen materials intersect with your attempts to look closely at things and ideas. At the end of the unit you should have a foothold in the process of using art materials to develop a visual language.</p>

<p>There are many options for further study, and students&#8217; interests and ideas will be part of deciding what to do in the next unit, should they choose to continue.</p>

<h2 id="transitioners">Transitioners</h2>

<p>This class is for students who have a developed practice in some non-painting field, art or otherwise, that serves them as a way of asking and answering questions about ideas and selves. Students should have a sense of their own interests and abilities that they want to bring to painting, and a desire to explore how the materials and methods of painting can expand or develop them. This class is more suitable for online students than the Beginner&#8217;s class. </p>

<p>The course is designed so that students&#8217; discussions of their interests, influences, and questions can overlap and inform each other. My role will be to facilitate these discussions and provide painting-specific research and material to connect these discussions to visual art. Specific technical instruction will be dependent on each students&#8217; individual interests and projects. 75% of the class will be in a group setting, and the rest will be one-on-one to facilitate specific, personal development.</p>

<p>The outcome of the first unit of this class will be a coherent statement of purpose for a visual art project, written or otherwise. Given sufficient student interest, subsequent units of this course could be developed with the goal of creating a group exhibition.</p>

  <p>This site is a combination of things I've said about painting without thinking about them very hard and without taking them very seriously and writing about painting that I've thought about harder and more seriously than almost anything else I've ever written. The material all developed over between 2015 and 2017 while I was working a lot on a <a href="http://wunnan.com/natura-morta" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="http://wunnan.com/pictures-of-flowers" target="_blank">series</a> of <a href="http://wunnan.com/paint-landscaping" target="_blank">paintings</a>. This project exists to spread the ideas laid out in both shit-taking form and essay form. Classes begin in early summer 2017, and more programs and projects will follow. If you'd like to be notified about them, sign up here.</p>
  <p>Set in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya" target="_blank">Alegreya</a>, entirely static and written by hand because that's faster than even <em>picking</em> a goddamn framework and I'm a goddamn <em>artist</em>.</p>
  <p>Oh yeah and my name's N&iacute;m, and you can see my other work <a href="http://wunnan.com/" target="_blank">here.</a>
