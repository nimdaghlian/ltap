## About this site

This site is home to a few projects that talk about paintings and the work they ask us to do, whether we are tying to make them or see them. It’s definitely about painting, but it’s also definitely about work. If you’re not a painter, but you do work that can be messy, uncooperative, or consistently surprising, it’s my hope that you’ll be able to relate to some of this.

## The projects 

<h3> #howtopaint</h3>

I tweet [easy](https://twitter.com/nimwunnan/status/671208043044990976){:target="blank"} to [follow](https://twitter.com/nimwunnan/status/655524378969436160){:target="blank"}, [step-by-step](https://twitter.com/nimwunnan/status/764603990210293760){:target="blank"} [instructions](https://twitter.com/nimwunnan/status/769689567683153920){:target="blank"} for making good paintings under the hashtag [#howtopaint](https://twitter.com/i/moments/921824804830773248){:target="blank"}. If you prefer tweets to be physical objects, check out the [book](#book). 

### The Thing I am Trying to Do

Instructions didn’t work? That’s a pretty common problem. I went to school for painting and I’m still trying to follow the handful of instructions I got there. Learning something that changes as you do it is a strange kind of work, where you have to keep asking “what is the thing I’m trying to do here?” I tugged on the thread of that question so much that it unraveled [into this essay](/the-thing-i-am-trying-to-do).

### Conceptual Labor

I first really learned about this kind of work through painting, but at the same time realized that it shows up in all sorts of different fields. So I jumped into action and, ten years later, wrote the [Theory of Conceptual Labor](http://conceptuallabor.com){:target="blank"}.

### Coming soon! A podcast!

>> And we decided that it was better to look at paintings on the radio than on the television. On the TV screen nothing is ever still, and this movement stops painting being painting. Whereas on the radio we see nothing, but we can listen to silence. And every painting has its own silence.

>> — John Berger

So, yeah, I’m starting a podcast about paintings — individual, specific paintings. It’s called _Let’s Talk About Paintings_, and it comes out in spring of 2019. Sign up here for updates!
