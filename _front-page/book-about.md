## About the book

Somehow my tweets have turned into a book. Features include not having to go onto Twitter, nearly as many new tweets as there are old ones, and an introduction, which you can read below.

Available for pre-order from [Quotidian press](https://quotidianpress.storenvy.com/products/25805373-howtopaint){:target="blank"}. 

## Introduction

It is more than a little strange to me to have written a book of tweets, but I can’t deny that I put real care into these short statements. I would like to say it was an accident, because I don’t want people to think I care about Twitter. I’m a painter, I care about painting. Twitter exasperates and depresses me. However, painting does that too, so at least in this way they are similar activities. 

Painting does it with the intimacy of a loved one you can’t let go, but Twitter feels like that time that someone threw a quarter out of a moving car right at my head while I was biking. Arriving with the immediate, smarting pain in my temple was a deeper, cutting indignation that I had become, for a moment, connected to this drive-by idiocy. That I had something to do with the kind of person that would huck a quarter at a bicyclist out of the window of a mid-90s chevy.
If my time in the studio leaves me grumpy, it’s because painting said something to me that I wasn’t quite ready to own up to. Even if painting’s being a dick about it, I know it’s right. Any resentment will catalyze into determination, and send me back to the studio. All my complaints are just that much moss gathering on the deep, stone foundation of love I have for the activity. I know some people feel this way about short statements on the internet. We all have our battles, but the campaigns we wage in the studio and on Twitter seemed, at first, too distant to ever overlap.

Tweets are networked speech. What you say, while you say it, is who you are. There is no private thought. One-dimensional clarity rises to the top. Virality is truth. 
The studio is a fortress of doubt where you build some slow, near-truth from the guts-outward. The thing-ness of paint rebuffs the fluttery notions of the self. It will tell you who you are, not the other way around.

The idea of learning to paint from a hashtag was funny to me at first because of how obviously useless and arrogant it was. It was after the quick chuckle that I’d notice that I had just said something I believed in. 

Behind the belch and snark of Twitter, there’s a poetry to its distilled statements. Behind the poetics of the studio, there are the moments you drop your phone onto a freshly primed canvas. The thing that lies in the middle is a kind of work, and it’s not just for painters. You have to laugh at it but you can’t write it off. Or maybe it’s worth taking seriously, but you should have a sense of humor about it. That’s how to paint.
